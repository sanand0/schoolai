## Generate data

I want to create a synthetic dataset for the Triage Agent demo based on the pitch below. We want to SNHU how the agent could intercept emails, WhatsApp messages, web activity from forms, and inquiries from any other channels, can be updated and categorized into the CRM automatically along with automated drafts of personal replies.

For this, in the context of schools like SNHU, think about and research the kind of channels they use for students and parents to inquire from an enrollment perspective. Suggest the kinds of messages they are likely to receive.

Generate an ultra-realistic synthetic dataset of ~100 messages across the different channels.

List fields that would be present in such data, briefly describing how the data might be distributed.
Think about who the audience might be and their objective / key questions.
Search online if required.
Remember: real data is messy. Make sure the generated data reflects relevant characteristics.
Generate this as `messages.json` file.

For each of thee messages, include a draft response if the question had been posed to SNHU. Ensure that the response is realistic and reflects SNHU's tone and values.

Keep in mind that a bot may not be qualified to (or allowed to) answer certain questions. Think about the areas where the bot would need to hand off to a human, and include examples of those as well.

Include the metadata that would accompany the draft response.

For example, while escalating, include a field that mentions the specific action that the bot should take to escalate the issue to a human advisor, how it might tag the message - e.g. what queue it should go into, what priority level it should be assigned, what's the reason for escalation, and what information it should pass along to them.

When responding with a draft, there would be similar fields such as citations, reasons for the response, and confidence level of the bot, etc.

In either case, think about the most important & useful metadata to include.

Ensure that `messages.json` includes the draft responses and metadata for each message.

Here's the pitch and context. Ignore what's irrelevant.

<SNHU-CONTEXT>
Here is the simple, ELI15 breakdown of what makes Lisa Marsh Ryerson tick and how you should angle your pitch.

**What Lisa Cares About (Her Focus Areas)**

- **Fairness and Finishing:** She is a first-generation college graduate who believes deeply in "equitable attainment". This means it’s not enough to just let students enroll; the school must actively help them overcome life's hurdles so they actually cross the finish line and graduate.
- **The 40 Million "Almost-There" Adults:** Her biggest target audience is the 40 million Americans who have some college credits but never got their degree. She wants to make it incredibly easy for these working adults (whom she calls "The Anders"—students _and_ parents, students _and_ workers) to come back to school.
- **Human Connection:** She hates the idea of online students feeling lonely or like just a number. She strongly believes in "social connectedness" and thinks university staff should act as human "guides" or coaches, not just rule-enforcers.
- **No "Blind Spots":** She wants all of the university's departments to share information (which she calls "radical collaboration") so that the school never misses the warning signs when a student is struggling and about to drop out.

**What You Should Pitch (And Why)**

You need to pitch your technology not as a way to replace human workers or save a quick buck, but as a tool to remove the frustrating paperwork so her staff can focus on caring for the students.

**1\. Pitch: Super-Fast AI Credit Checking**

- **What it is:** Straive's AI can instantly read and organize messy, 20-year-old college transcripts, military records, or work certificates so human advisors can easily see what credits a student already has.
- **Why it works:** Adult learners hate waiting weeks to find out if their past hard work will count toward their new degree. By speeding this up, you directly help her goal of removing roadblocks for those 40 million adults, saving them time and money.

**2\. Pitch: Upgrading "Penny" to a Problem-Solver**

- **What it is:** Taking SNHU's current friendly chatbot (Penny) and making it smart enough to actually complete tasks (like filing financial aid forms), while having Straive's human support team standing by 24/7 if the bot senses a student is stressed.
- **Why it works:** Lisa specifically says technology should be the "hand" doing chores, while humans are the "heart" giving emotional support. This pitch proves you understand that balance. You use AI to handle the midnight password resets, and instantly transfer crying or stressed students to a real, empathetic human.

**3\. Pitch: The "Blind Spot" Detector (Data Unification)**

- **What it is:** Connecting all of SNHU's disconnected computer systems so they talk to each other. If a student misses a payment, fails a quiz, and stops logging in all in the same week, the system flags it.
- **Why it works:** It solves her exact fear of having institutional "blind spots". You are giving her advisors a smart early-warning system so they can reach out and offer a lifeline to a struggling student _before_ that student gives up and drops out.

</SNHU-CONTEXT>

## Dashboard

Move `messages.json` to `triage/messages.json`.

Based on the context in `prompts.md` and the dataset in `triage/messages.json`, show a realtime simulation of the Triage Agent in action as a single page dashboard, `triage/index.html` (along with associated scripts, styles, or any other assets you need to create under `triage/`)

It should include:

- Realtime simulation of messages coming in from different channels, depicted visually with icons and labels.
- Rich, visual animation of the messages flowing in.
- Show each message being processed by the Triage Agent, with the draft response and metadata appearing alongside it. Simulate an LLM "thinking" by showing a loading animation for a realistic amount of time before the metadata appears. Then "stream" the responses word by word to make it feel more dynamic and real.
- Show the accumulation of messages, responses, triage resolutions, escalations, and other relevant metrics on a dashboard in real time.
- Include visualizations of key metrics such as response time, escalation rate, resolution rate, and student satisfaction (if applicable).
- Add a collapsible "Controls" panel. Under this, allow playing, pausing, resetting, and adjusting the speed of the simulation.

High visual quality is critical. Follow the visual style, animation, and effects used in the The Pudding (pudding.cool): custom data visualizations, playful explanatory graphics, bold typography, interactive chart explorations, and visual format innovation.

Think carefully about what will be meaningful and useful for the audience to see. The goal is to make the Triage Agent's impact tangible and compelling to a business audience - to help them understand how the agent will help reduce inquiry load, improve qualit of responses, and improve enrollment outcomes.

Plan the dashboard design and layout carefully before you start coding. Consider the user experience and how to best visualize the flow of messages and the agent's processing. Use animations and interactions to make it engaging, but ensure it remains clear and informative.

## Corrections

- Set --max-width to 1920px.
- Change the title to "Triage Agent. Change the ".hero-lede" to explain the business benefit in a clear, compelling way with typical metrics, in 2-3 paragraphs.
- Remove all references to SNHU, simulations, synthetic data, etc. and make it look like a real triage agent dashboard for a real but unnamed client.
- Rename "Omnichannel Intake → Agent → Outcomes" to something smaller. Also, ensure that that row, which also has "Live Message Processing" and "Resolution Feed" cards don't change width as the content changes.
  - Also ensure that these cards have an equal height. Auto-scroll the height of the inbound message, draft response, and anything else that might have a long content.
  - Run the simulation for a while to see how the size changes as the content changes. That shouldn't happen. Think of the best way to make this happen.
- Show the number of messages processed (Auto drafts, Human handoffs) visually apart from showing the number - e.g. small multiples of icons representing each message.
- Don't show the total number of messages in Email, Web Chat, etc. That makes it look like a simulation rather than real streaming data. Instead, show the number of messages processed so far, and as new messages are processed, increment the count of the channel.
- In the resolution log, clicking on any draft card should open a popup showing the full message with metadata.

## Corrections 2

- Auto-play on load.
- On wide screens, move the Activity Log card to a separate row by itself. Re-design it to look attractive even with this wide design. Let the Live Message Processing card take up the width freed up by the Activity Log.
- Ensure that the icons in Auto Drafts and Human Handoffs never spill outside their cards and always wrap. Let them have the same size always.
- Explain the Throughput + Backlog card with a clear, compelling lede that explains the business impact of these metrics.
- The "Response Time vs Legacy Baseline" card is boring, with the legacy baseline of 240m and agent response of just a few min being static and making the chart mostly empty. Replace this with a more dynamic and useful visualization.
- Drop the "Channel mix" card and related code (if any). Move the "Routing Pressure" card on the same row (and to the left of) "Impact Storyboard".

## Corrections 3

- The "median" and "under 5m" stats in "Response Time Distribution + SLA Bands" overlap with the axis. Move it below the chart, e.g. alongside the legend.
- Instead of showing +n against the message count indicators, find a way to show the actual counts, i.e. with one icon per message. I don't mind smaller dots or other creative layouts.
- In Throughput + Backlog, the chart shows a blue and red line but the legend shows green and red. Is that right?

## Corrections 4

In "Controls":
Replace "Stream speed" with "Number of agents". The idea is to make it look like we're achieving speed by adding more agents.
Replace "Play" with "Start" and "Reset" with "Restart".
Replace "Play, pause, reset, speed" with "Start, pause, restart, scale".
